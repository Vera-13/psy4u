  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>
  Trauma is the lasting emotional response that often results from living through a distressing event. The effects of trauma can vary widely from person to person. Some individuals may experience immediate and intense reactions, while others may not show signs of trauma until later in life. Common responses to trauma include shock, disbelief, anxiety, depression, nightmares, flashbacks, and difficulty trusting others. Experiencing a traumatic event can harm a person's sense of safety, sense of self, and ability to regulate emotions and navigate relationships. Long after the traumatic event occurs, people with trauma can still often feel shame, helplessness, powerlessness and intense fear.
